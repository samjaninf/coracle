  <p>Congratulations, you're ready to go! A few tips for beginners:</p>
  <ul class="list-disc px-8">
    <li>
      Make sure you save your private key (or "nsec"). This is your password, and it can't be
      recovered!
    </li>
    <li>
      Engagement bait doesn't work here - be genuine, ask questions, and offer thoughtful comments
      to grow your following.
    </li>
    <li>
      Nostr doesn't have a trust and safety team. You're responsible for curating your own
      experience, just like on the open internet.
